# GoldBadge_FinalProject
A series of projects solving business logic problems. All problems are creating in a console app in C#. All of the repository classes are also paired with a unit test project to ensure that all of the CRUD functionality is working as expected.

# Cafe
Cafe is a solution to this problem -> Komodo cafe is getting a new menu. The manager wants to be able to create new menu items, delete menu items, and receive a list of all items on the cafe's menu. She needs a console app.

# Claims
Claims is a solution for a fictitious insurance company. They need software that will allow them to queue claims up and then deal with them in the order that they were recieved. Each claim needs an ID, Type of Claim, Description for the claim, Amount the claim is worth, date of incident, date of claim, and if the claim is valid.

# Badges
Badges is also a solution for a fictitious insurance company. They need software to track, read, and update the badges and what doors those badges open. It is handled by a dictionary of badge Id's and a list of doors that they can open. 

# Outings
Outings is a console app that the accounting firm needed to track the cost for corporate outings. Each outing has an event type (Golf, Bowling, Amusement Park, and Concert), number of people that attended, the date of the event, the total cost, and the cost per person. The accounting team also needed to be able to see the total cost of all outings, and the total cost for each type of event.

# Greeting
Greeting is a piece of software that tracks all the potential, past, and current customers for a fictitious insurance company. It then generates an email message to be sent to each member dependant on that customers status. It also sorts the list of customer by their last name so that way the administrators can make sure that everything is in good shape.

# Green Plan
Green Plan is an app that tracks cars and their what fuel they run on. There is a master list of all cars owned by the company but they also need to be able to access lists separated by the fuel type.
